        Mutual funds offer investors a great way to diversify their holdings instantly. Unlike stocks, investors can put
        a small amount of money into one or more funds and access a diverse pool of investment options. So you can buy
        units in a mutual fund that invests in as many as 20 to 30 different securities.
